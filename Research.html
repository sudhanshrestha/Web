			  			old black dull site I too added a partical.js plugin in the home page so that it does not

    				The refrence I took from the site <a href="https://www.maxreeves.net/about"><strong>maxreeves.net</strong></a>

    				<a href="https://www.maxreeves.net/about">maxreeves.net</a> was simple and minimalistic which 
    				i liked so i implemented it in my website most of  my website design was done  with the thought of keeping it simple. 
    				I added the navigation with some hover effect and instead of putting the branding of the site in the middle 
    				I kept it in the top left . I made the  look of the navigation bar a bit big for the hover effect to look a bit better.

    				mind I create my about page with a short description about myself and a picture of me in the side. 
    				To make the page more interactive i added my socialmedia platforms link in icons and added a gallery
    				of some pictures i took . I even added a mouse hover effect over my photo for some fun so whenever the mouse is hovered
    				over the picture it changes.In my case to make it intresting it changes from a black and white picture to a coloured one.
