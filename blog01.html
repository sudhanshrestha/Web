        I remember playing my first game in a black and white TV with a console
        plugged in it and playing a Contra. It was my first time playing a game
        as in a console and although the game’s graphics were in tiny pixelated
        form, I was quickly hooked on to it. Video Games have developed quite
        much from then games now day come in high quality with real life graphic
        which make you go “Wow!”.<br />
        These games have been a digital source of entertainment these days and
        ages from kids to adults play them these days. These games have been
        making a huge impact on the society as due to these games many people
        children specially are spending more time in homes instead of going out
        and play , this also result in making the newer generation of children
        more socially awkward and as this industry is growing with game that are
        pretty much close to reality with Virtual Reality(VR) who know what will
        happen. <br /><br />
        <img

          align="right"
          height="400px"

          style="padding: 20px;"
        />

        Games are very fun to play and are exciting, so we waste much of our
        time on them and are so into it that we spend most of our time playing
        them and in a blink of an eye time goes by and we don’t even notice it.
        Although these games have some of the negative effect these also have
        their own positive impact which most of us fail to notice. As most of
        the younger generation are into them these younger ones can get to know
        about various things such as the issue related to violence, call of duty
        and responsibility. They get rewards if they follow the rules of the
        games and if they try to cut line or do some illegal things inside the
        game which can also be related in real life, they get punished which
        makes them aware the negative and positives things. Playing games have
        also proven to be make our reflexes fast as modern First-Person Shooter
        games (FPS) are fast paced and need quick reflexes. Some games also
        provide extra knowledge about various things and even history sometimes
        which are good for the younger generations. <br /><br />

        Video games create a separate alternate universe for us to enjoy if we
        can make them more creative and knowledgeable then it will be much
        better. Rather than restrict the children’s form games we should let
        them enjoy games which may benefit them and the adults can also enjoy
        these games with them in doing so the young ones minds can be sharpened
        ad the adults can take this time to relax and have fun.
